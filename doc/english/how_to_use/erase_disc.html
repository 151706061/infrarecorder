		<dt>To erase a rewritable disc, you can either use the menu:</dt>
		<dd><strong>Actions <img src="../images/arrow.png"> Erase Rewritable Disc...</strong></dd>
		<dt>or the toolbar button:</dt>
		<dd><img src="../images/button_erase.bmp"></dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Recorder</h2>
	<p>Please select the recorder that you want to use for erasing the disc.</p>
	<h2>Erase Method</h2>
	<p>Select one of the four erase methods to use. The <em>Erase the entire disc
	   </em> method will destroy all data on the disc. This operation may take
	   a long time. Using the <em>Minimally erase the disc</em> method will only
	   cause the table of contents (TOC), PMA and pregap to be erased. Basicly the
	   actual data is never erased from the disc (it will not be accessible),
	   the data will instead be overwritten when you write to the disc the next
	   time. This method is very fast can can often be done in about 10 seconds.
	   The <em>Unclose last session</em> method uncloses the last session (on a
	   closed multi-session disc) allowing more sessions to be added to the disc.
	   The last method <em>Erase last session</em> will simply just erase the last
	   session on the disc. This may take long or short time depending on the size
	   of the session.</p>
	<h2>Other Options</h2>
	<p>If the table of contents (TOC) for some reason has been damaged on a
	   disc, InfraRecorder will not erase the disc unless the <em>Ignore illegal
	   TOC</em> option is set.</p>
	<p>Activating the <em>Simulation</em> option will cause InfraRecorder to
	   perform the selected action but with the recorder's laser turned off. This
	   option is recommended if you are unsure if the operation will succeed or
	   not.</p>
