	<h1>General Settings</h1>
	<p>The only general setting that you are able to change is the disc label. The
	   default suggested label is based on the date and time of when the project
	   was created. Please note that the label applies to the same restrictions as
	   general file names in the project (see the <em>ISO Settings</em> section).
	   </p>
	<h1>ISO Settings</h1>
	<h2>Level</h2>
	<p>This option sets the ISO conformance level which basicly are different
	   levels of file name restrictions. There are three levels supported in
	   InfraRecorder:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><span>Level 1 uses file names in the 8.3 format (eight characters with a
		    three-character extension), upper case letters, numbers and underscore.
		    The maximum directory depth is eight.</span></li>
		<li><span>Level 2 allows file names to be up to 31 characters long.</span>
		    </li>
		<li><span>Level 3 allows files to be fragmented (mainly to allow packet
		    writing, or incremental CD recording).</span></li>
		<li><span>Level 4 does not really exist, but when selected the ISO-9660:1999
		    (which is ISO-9660 version 2) standard is used. This standard allows
		    file names to be up to 207 characters long and the directory structure
		    may be more than eight levels deep.</span></li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Character Set</h2>
	<p>Defines the character set used in the local file names included in the
	   project. InfraRecorder tries to automatically detect the character set
	   used on your system.</p>
	<h2>Format</h2>
	<p>This option specifies the format that should be used when writing your
	   project data to a disc. <em>Mode 1</em> is normally used when creating
	   regular non multi-session discs while <em>Mode 2</em> should be used when
	   creating multi-session discs. <em>Mode 1</em> allows 2048 bytes of data per
	   sector, <em>Mode 2</em> allows 2336 bytes of data per sector (A CD-ROM
	   sector is 2352 bytes large).</p>
	<h2>Other Options</h2>
	<p>The <em>Use Joliet file name extension</em> adds Joliet directory records
	   to the disc in addition to regular ISO9660 file names. The joliet extension
	   is commonly used on Windows systems and allows unicode file names with a
	   maximum length of 64 characters.</p>
	<p>If you want to use even longer file names you can enable the <em>Allow more
	   than 64 characters for Joliet names</em> option. This is not fully
	   compatible with the Joliet specification but seems to work. The maximum
	   character length is extended to 103 characters.</p>
	<p>The <em>Include UDF support in the generated file system</em> option is
	   self explanatory. UDF support is currently in alpha status, and for this
	   reason it's not possible to generate UDF only filesystems.</p>
	<p>The <em>Omit version number from ISO9660 file names</em> option is self
	   explanatory.</p>
	<h1>Fields</h1>
	<p>This secion contains options to specify information about the people behind
	   the CD-project. The <em>Publisher</em>, <em>Preparer</em>, <em>System</em>
	  and <em>Volume set</em> fields should be edited directly, the other fields
	  often contains file names due to the limited character length of 36
	  characters.</p>
	<h1>Audio Settings</h1>
	<p>This secion allows you to create CD-Text information. CD-Text is a format
	   supported by some (many?) CD-players that allows track and artist
	   information to be displayed when the CD is playing. These options are
	   available in audio and mixed-mode projects.</p>
	<h1>Boot Settings</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>This section is only available on data projects and allows you to specify
		    up to 63 boot images that will be used to create an "El Torito" bootable
		    disc. To add a new boot image to the project, click the <em>Add boot
		    image</em> button:</dt>
		<dd><img src="../../images/button_add.bmp"></dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Boot Catalog</h2>
	<p>This option specifies the path and filename of the boot catalog to be used
	   when making an "El Torito" bootable disc. The path name should be relative
	   to the root on the disc. The file will be inserted into the output tree and
	   not created in the source filesystem. Please make sure that the specified file
	   name does not conflict with an existing file.</p>
