		<dt>Copying an audio disc requires more steps than copying a data disc. First
	   	    you must save the audio tracks on your hard drive. To do so, open the
		    tracks dialog by:</dt>
		<dd><strong>Actions <img src="../images/arrow.png"> Manage Tracks...</strong></dd>
		<dt>The windows should look similar to this screenshot when you have selected
		    your source device and inserted an audio disc:</dt>
		<dd><img src="../images/screenshot_managetracks.png"></dd>
		<dt>Now select the tracks you want to save (copy) by clicking and holding the
		    shift or control button. When you have selected the tracks press the <em>
		    save tracks button</em>:
		<dd><img src="../images/button_savetracks.bmp"></dd>
	</dl>
	<p>You will now be prompted to select a target directory for the tracks.
	   Please go ahead and select a folder of your choice. When you have selected
	   a folder all the tracks that you have selected will be saved there (unless
	   any major read errors occured).</p>
	<p>You next step is to create a new audio project and add the tracks you just
	   saved to it. Please read this <a href="working_with_projects/getting_started.html">
	   topic</a> for more information.</p>
