	<p><strong>InfraRecorder does not my disc devices, how do I solve this 
	           problem?</strong>
	   <br/>This is most likely a permission issue. By default InfraRecorder
	        uses an interface called SPTI to access disc devices. On Windows
	        2000, XP and 2003 systems administrator permissions are required in
	        order to use SPTI.</p>
	<p>If you want to allow limited user accounts to access disc devices using
	   SPTI, please do the following when logged in as an administrator:</p>
	<ol>
	    <li><span>Navigate "Start" then "Run" in the Windows
	              start-menu.</span></li>
	    <li><span>Type "secpol.msc" without the quotes and press the OK
	              button.</span></li>
	    <li><span>Navigate "Local Policies" then "Security Options" in the
	              tree.</span></li>
	    <li><span>Change "Devices: Restrict CD-ROM access to locally logged-on
	              user only" item from "Disabled" to "Enabled.".</span></li>
	</ol>
	<p>Please note that some versions of Windows (Windows XP home for example)
	   does not have "secpol.msc". If using such a system please do the
	   following instead (while logged in as an administrator):</p>
	<ol>
	    <li><span>Navigate "Start" then "Run" in the Windows
	              start-menu.</span></li>
	    <li><span>Type "regedit" without the quotes and press the OK
	              button.</span></li>
	    <li><span>Navigate "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE", "SOFTWARE", "Microsoft",
	              "Windows NT", "CurrentVersion" and finally "Winlogon" in the
	              tree</span></li>
	    <li><span>In the selected path, add a string value named
	              "allocatecdroms" with the value "1" (without the
	              quotes). If the string value already exist with the value
	              "0", simply change it to "1".</span></li>
