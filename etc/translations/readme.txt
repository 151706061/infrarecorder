Thank you for your help translating InfraRecorder!

The file to be translated is named English.irl. Your translation should use the
same file extension and be placed in the "InfraRecorder\Languages" folder.

When you send me your translation, please include a translation of the
following ten strings (used by the setup program):

01: "InfraRecorder Core Files (required)"
02: "Start Menu Shortcuts"
03: "Desktop Shortcut"
04: "Quick Launch Shortcut"
05: "Language Files"
06: "The core files required to use InfraRecorder."
07: "Adds icons to your start menu for easy access."
08: "Adds an icon to your desktop."
09: "Adds an icon to your quick launch bar."
10: "Language files used for supporting different languages in InfraRecorder."

You may include any copyright comments in the beginning of the translation file
if you wish. For example:

; InfraRecorder Swedish Translation
; Version 0.44
: Date: November 7th 2007
; Contact: user@domain.com
; Size: 36 KiB

Please note that the section named [translation] not should be translated but
contain information about your translation. InfraRecorder 0.40 and newer will
support translated help files. If you have translated the help file it should
be specified in your translation so that InfraRecorder can find it. To do so,
just specify the location and name of the translated help file as value number
0x0004 in the translation section. The translated help file should be placed in
the same directory as the translation. Example:
  [translation]
  0x0001=Christian Kindahl
  0x0002=November 7th 2007
  0x0003=0.44
  0x0004=Languages\Swedish.chm
The help file value (0x0004) is optional. If your translation does not include
a help file this value should not exist.
