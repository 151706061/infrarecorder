Some InfraRecorder components depends on the following 3rd party libraries:
 * LAME: http://lame.sourceforge.net/
 * libogg: http://www.xiph.org/ogg/
 * libvorbis: http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/

Since the InfraRecorder solution references the above projects their sources
must be unpacked to this directory.
