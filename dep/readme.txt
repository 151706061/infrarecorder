Some InfraRecorder components depends on the following 3rd party projects:
 * cdrtools: http://cdrecord.berlios.de/
 * LAME: http://lame.sourceforge.net/
 * libogg: http://www.xiph.org/ogg/
 * libsndfile: http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
 * libvorbis: http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/

Since the InfraRecorder solution references the above projects their
sources or in some cases binaries must be unpacked to their corresponding
subdirectory.
