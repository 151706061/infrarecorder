	<h1>General Settings</h1>
	<p>The <em>Check if autorun is enabled on each startup</em> option specifies
	   whether you want InfraRecorder to check if autorun enabled on each startup
	   or not. It is recommended that autorun is turned of because leaving autorun
	   enabled causes Windows to poll the CD drive while recording, which might
	   damage your CD.</p>
	<p>If you want InfraRecorder to remember the last active folder in the
	   <em>Explorer View</em> you should check the <em>Remember the last active
	   folder</em> option. You can also specify a folder on your own that will be
	   the default every time InfraRecorder starts.</p>
	<p>The <em>Temporary folder</em> option lets you specify which folder that
	   should be used when temporarily storing files on your harddrive, for
	   example disc images. If your harddrive/partition (which stores the
	   temporary folder) is almost full it can be a good idea to use a temporary
	   folder on another drive.</p>
	<h1>Advanced Settings</H1>
	<p>If you want to enable the log feature of InfraRecorder, enable the<em>
	   Enable program log</em> option. This can be usefull when trying to locate a
	   possible bug/error in InfraRecorder. It's not recommended that you enable
	   log support if you do not intend to log a special event because InfraRecorder
	   requires more memory and CPU-time when the log support is enabled.</p>
	<p>The <em>Enable smoke effect</em> option enables or disables the smoke effect
	   displayed during writing processes. The smoke effect requires Windows Vista
	   Aero to be enabled. If Aero is not enabled this option will have no effect.</p>
	<p>The <em>FIFO buffer size</em> option lets you specify the size of the RAM
	   buffer that is used in addition to your recorders physical buffer. Icreasing
	   the buffer size may result in a more stable recording process. As a rule of
	   thumb, the FIFO size should be at least equal to the size of the pysical
	   buffer of the CD/DVD-Recorder and no more than half of the physical amount
	   of RAM available in the machine. If you often record discs on-the-fly, this
	   buffer should be large (for example 128 MiB) to prevent buffer underruns.
	<h1>Language Settings</h1>
	<p>A list of available languages are displayed in the combo box. To change
	   language, simply select the language you want in the combo box, click the
	   OK-button and restart InfraRecorder. If your language is not available,
	   check the InfraRecorder website to see if a translation in your language
	   exists.</p>
	<h1>Shell Extension</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>The shell extension (when enabled) adds additional menu entries to the
	   	    shell context menu:</dt>
		<dd><img src="../images/screenshot_shellextension.png"></dd>
	</dl>
	<p>It adds the options to record disc images and InfraRecorder projects
	   just by right-clicking on them.</p>
	<p>The shell extension can be customized to display the items in a submenu.
	   To display the context menu items in a submenu enable the <em>Display
	   context menu items in a submenu</em> option.</p>
	<p>It can also be customized to not display icons on the menu items by
	   disabling the <em>Display menu item icons</em> option.</p>
	<h2>Register the Shell Extension</h2>
	<p>The shell extension does not work automatically with disc images and
	   InfraRecorder projects. When enabling the <em>Enalbe InfraRecorder shell
	   extension</em>, InfraRecorder tells Windows Explorer that it offer other
	   applications to use it's extended features.</p>
	<p>To make Windows Explorer use the additional features supplied by the
	   InfraRecorder shell extension, the shell extension must be registered with
	   the file types that should be able to use the extra features.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>There are a set of predefined file extensions available in the list. To
		    associate the InfraRecorder shell extension with a file type, just check
		    the item in the list view. You can add any additional file types to the 
		    list by pressing the <em>Add file extension</em> button:</dt>
