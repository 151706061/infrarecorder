	<p>This topic covers the read options that appear on various places
	   in InfraRecorder, for example when you want to copy a disc either
	   to a disc image or to another disc.</p>
	<p>Altough these options are accessable in many different contexts as
	   mentioned above, they are always presented in a similar way:</p>
	<p><img src="../images/screenshot_read.png"></p>
	<h1>Read Settings</h1>
	<h2>Ignore read errors</h2>
	<p>Enabling this option will cause the high level error checking not to abort
	   when errors are found in the data stream. The drive will also be switched
	   into a mode where it ignores read errors in data sectors that are a result
	   of uncorrectable ECC/EDC errors before reading.</p>
	<h2>Read all sub-channel data and the full TOC</h2>
	<p>When this option is enabled the disc will be read with all sub-channel
	   data and a full TOC. The full TOC data will be put into a file with
	   similar name to the specified image name but with the suffix
	   <strong>.toc</strong>.</p>
	<h2>Read speed</h2>
	<p>Select the speed to use when reading the disc. Selecting the <em>
	   Maximum</em> option will automatically select the highest speed that the
	   drive is capable of. Only MMC compliant drives will benefit from this
	   option. The speed of non MMC drives is not changed.</p>
	<p>Using a lower speed may increase the readability of a disc.</p>
