	<p>Please note that this page contains information on how to copy a data disc.
	   If you want to copy an audio disc (which is an entirely different process)
	   please see <a href="copy_audio_disc.html">this</a> topic.</p>
	<p>When you want to copy a data disc you have two main options which is if you
	   want to copy the disc directly to another drive (for example from a
	   CD-reader to a CD-recorder) or to a disc image on your hard drive.</p>
	<h1>Copy to a Compact Disc</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>To copy a disc directly to another drive, use the menu:</dt>
		<dd><strong>Actions <img src="../images/arrow.png"> Copy Disc <img src="../images/arrow.png"> to a Compact Disc...</strong></dd>
		<dt>or the toolbar button:</dt>
		<dd><img src="../images/button_copy.bmp"></dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Source</h2>
	<p>Select the source drive which contains the compact disc that you want to
	   make a copy of.</p>
	<h2>Target</h2>
	<p>Select the target drive which contains the empty compact disc that you want
	   to write the copy to. Please note that the target drive can not be the same
	   as the source drive.</p>
	<h2>On The Fly</h2>
	<p>Writing <em>on the fly</em> means that the data will be read from the
	   source drive and then directly written to the target (recorder) without any
	   buffering on your hard drive (only a relatively small memory buffer is
	   used). If your source drive would fail to read some sectors on the source
	   disc it might not be able to supply the target (recorder) with data fast
	   enough, resulting in write errors on the target disc. However most new
	   recorder offer some kind of buffer underrun protection technology that
	   should protect the targe disc if this event occurs.</p>
	<p>When the <em>On the fly</em> option is disabled a temporary disc image will
	   first be created on your hard drive. The disc image will then be written to
	   the target drive. Using this option requires more free disc space on your
	   hard drive but is recommended in most cases.</p>
	<h2>Clone Disc</h2>
	<p>When this option is enabled all sub-channel data and the full TOC on the
	   source disc will also be copied to the target disc. This option must be
	   enabled when copying a mixed-mode disc, otherwise only the data track will
	   be copied. It's recommended that your record the target disc using the
	   raw96r write method. If that method is not supported by your recorder,
	   please try the raw16 write method.</p>
	<h2>Read Options</h2>
	<p>The read options are described in <a href="read_options.html">this</a> topic.</p>
	<h2>Other Options</h2>
	<p>The other options are described in <a href="burn_options.html">this</a> topic.</p>

	<h1>Copy to a Disc Image</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>To copy a disc to a disc image on the hard drive, use the menu:</dt>
		<dd><strong>Actions <img src="../images/arrow.png"> Copy Disc <img src="../images/arrow.png"> to a Disc Image...</strong></dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Source</h2>
	<p>Select the source drive which contains the compact disc that you want to
	   make a copy of.</p>
	<h2>Image File</h2>
	<p>Select the location and name of the disc image. Please note that you will
	   approximateley need the same amount of size avaiable on your hard drive as
	   the compact disc contains.</p>
	<h2>Read Options</h2>
