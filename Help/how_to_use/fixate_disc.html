		<dt>A fixated disc is a disc that is considered to be finished. Fixation is
		    normally automatically done after recording data to a disc. This tool is
		    usefull if data has been written but the disc for some reason hasn't been
		    fixated. To fixate a disc, use the menu:</dt>
		<dd><strong>Actions <img src="../images/arrow.png"> Fixate Disc...</strong></dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Recorder</h2>
	<p>Please select the recorder that contains the disc that you want to fixate.</p>
	<h2>Other Options</h2>
	<p>Activating the <em>Simulation</em> option will cause InfraRecorder to
	   perform the selected action but with the recorder's laser turned off. This
	   option is recommended if you are unsure if the operation will succeed or
	   not.</p>
