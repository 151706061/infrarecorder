		<dt>A closed disc is a disc that is considered to be finished.
			Normally a disc is automatically closed after recording data. This tool is
		    useful if data has been written but the disc for some reason hasn't been
		    closed. To close a disc, use the menu:</dt>
		<dd><strong>Actions <img src="../images/arrow.png"> Close Disc...</strong></dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Recorder</h2>
	<p>Please select the recorder that contains the disc that you want to close.</p>
	<h2>Other Options</h2>
	<p>Activating the <em>Simulation</em> option will cause InfraRecorder to
	   perform the selected action but with the recorder's laser turned off. This
	   option is recommended if you are unsure if the operation will succeed or
	   not.</p>
