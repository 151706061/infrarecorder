	<p>This topic covers the burn/recording options that appear on various places
	   in InfraRecorder, for example when you want to burn a custom compilation,
	   a disc image, or copy a disc.</p>
	<p>Altough these options are accessable in many different contexts as
	   mentioned above, they are always presented in a similar way:</p>
	<p><img src="../images/screenshot_burn.png"></p>
	<h1>General Settings</h1>
	<h2>On The Fly</h2>
	<p>When recording on the fly the file system will be generated while recording
	   which may increase the risk of write errors. If this option is turned off a
	   temporary disc image will first be created on the hard drive and then
	   recorded to the disc. The preffered setting is usally off, it should gernally
	   only be enabled when you are low on disc space.</p>
	<h2>Verify the Disc After Writing</h2>
	<p>Enabling this option will cause InfraRecorder to perform a CRC
	   comparison between the files on your harddrive and the files on the newly
	   recorded disc to make sure that all files have been written to the disc
	   without any problems.</p>
	<h2>Write Speed</h2>
	<p>Select the write speed to use when recording the disc. Selecting the <em>
	   Maximum</em> option will automatically select the highest speed that the
	   recorder is capable of.</p>
	<h2>Write Method</h2>
	<p>This option selects what method that you want to use when recording the
	   disc. Only the options that your recorder supports will be available in the
	   combo box.</p>
	<p><em>Session-At-Once (SAO)</em> often refered to as Disc-At-Once (DAO)
	   writes all of the data (including lead-in and lead-out) in one pass. Not
	   allowing any interruptions in the data stream. Additional session/data can
	   not be added at a later time. Please note that DVDs must be written using
           this method.</p>
	<p><em>Track-At-Once (TAO)</em> writes each track independently which requires
	   link blocks between two tracks. Older recorders often forces a two second
	   pause (pregap) between two tracks whereas newer recorders often can adjust
	   the amount of pregap data (see the option described below).</p>
	<p><em>TAO with zero pregap</em> uses the Track-At-Once method described above
	   and tries to set the pregap data length to zero, reducing the number of
	   link blocks between the tracks to a minimal amount.</p>
	<p><em>Raw writing (raw96r)</em> writes data in raw mode using 2352 byte
	   sectors plus 96 bytes of raw P-W subchannel data resulting in a sector size
	   of 2448 bytes. This is the preferred raw writing mode since it gives the
	   best control over the CD writing process.</p>
	<p><em>Raw writing (raw16)</em> writes data in raw mode using 2352 bytes
	   sectors plus 16 bytes of P-Q subchannel data resulting in a sector size of
	   2368 bytes. If a recorder does not support the raw96r raw writing mode,
	   this is the preferred raw writing mode. This write method does not support
	   CD-Text.</p>
	<p><em>Raw writine (raw96p)</em> writes data in raw mode using 2352 byte
	   sectors plus 96 bytes of raw P-W subchannel data resulting in a sector size
	   of 2448 bytes. This is the less preferred raw writing mode, mainly because	
	   only a very few recorders support it and some of these recorders have bugs
	   in the firmware implementation. Don't use this method if your recorder
	   supports the raw96r or raw16 raw writing method.</p>
	<p><font color="#FF0000">Important: Please note that raw write methods
	   requires significantly more CPU-time than the other write methods. If your
	   CPU is too slow you might get problems with buffer underruns.</font></p>
	<h2>Other Options</h2>
	<p>Activating the <em>Simulation</em> option will cause InfraRecorder to
	   perform the selected action but with the recorder's laser turned off. This
	   option is recommended if you are unsure if the operation will succeed or
	   not.</p>
	<p><em>Buffer underrun protection</em> is a feature in most newer recorders
	   which allows the writing process to continue even if a buffer underrun
	   error occurr. This feature often have different names by different vendors,
	   for example: Yamaha Lossless-Link, Sanyo	BURN-Proof, Ricoh Just-Link, etc.
	   </p>
	<p>The <em>Pad data tracks</em> option will when enabled cause 15 sectors
	   containing zeros to be written after each data track and audio track data
	   to be padded to be a multiple of 2352 bytes. The reason why you might want
	   to enable this option is if your CD-reader has problems reading the last
	   sectors of a track or if you intend to use the disc on a Linux ISO-9660
	   filesystem with the read ahead bug.<p>
	<p>Disabling the <em>Fixate the disc after writing option</em> will cause the
	   last session (if using SAO mode) or track (if using a TAO mode) not to be
	   fixated (closed). This can be usefull if you want to record a CD in
	   multiple steps.</p>
	<p><font color="#FF0000">Important: Creating a non-fixated disc is not the
	   same as creating a multi-session disc.</font></p>
	<hr>
	<h1><a name="advanced">Advanced Settings</a></h1>
	<p>The <em>Allow overburning</em> option allows you to write more than the
	   official size to a medium. The fact is that most blank media can hold more
	   space than the official size, as the official size of the lead-out area on
	   a disc is 90 seconds (6750 sectors) and a disc usually works if there are
	   at only 150 sectors of lead-out. All media may be overburned by atleast 88
	   seconds (6600 sectors). Most recorders can only do overburning using the
	   SAO and raw write methods. Some recorders does not allow you to do as much
	   overburning as you would like and limits the size of a disc to certain
	   size. This problem may be circumvented by writing the CD in raw mode
	   because this way the recorder has no chance to find the medium size before
	   starting the recording process.</h2>
	<p>When the <em>Swap audio byte order</em> option is enabled audio data is
	   assumed to be in byte-swapped (little-endian) order. Some type of recorders
	   for example from Yamaha, Sony and the new SCSI-3/MMC recorders require
	   audio data to be presented in little-endian order, while other recorders
	   require audio data to be presented in big-endian (network) byte order
	   normally used by the SCSI protocoll. The byte order required by your
	   recorder will automatically be detected. The only time you may want to use
	   this option is if your data stream is in Intel (little-endian) order.</p>
	<p><em>Ignore medium size</em> can be enabled when you want to ignore the
	   known size of the medium. It should be used with extreme care. This option
	   implies overburning.</p>
	<p>The <em>Set the SCSI IMMED flag</em> option will, as the name suggest set
	   the IMMED flag for certain SCSI commands. Setting the IMMED flag will
	   request the commands to return immediateley while the operation proceeds in
	   the background, making the bus usable for other devices and avoiding a
	   system freeze. This can be usefull on broken system with ATAPI harddisk and
	   CD/DVD-writer or the same bus or with SCSI systems that don't use
	   disconnect/reconnect. These systems will freeze while blanking or fixating
	   a disc or while the recorder is filling up a session to the minimum amount.
	   Please note that not all recorders support the IMMED flag.</p>
	<p><em>Yamaha Audio Master Q. R.</em> is a feature which is used to create
	   high quality audio discs that have less reading problems in Hi-Fi players.
	   It is implemented as a variant of the SAO write mode so it will only work
	   if you select the Session-At-Once (SAO) write method. This feature does not
	   work with all writing speeds and does not allow the same amount of data to
	   be written to a disc due to that fact that the pits on the CD will be
	   larger than normal. If this feature is enabled, a 74 minute CD will have
	   the capacity of 63 minutes and a 80 minute CD will have the capacity
	   reduced to 68 minutes. This feature also works with data discs.</p>
	<p>The <em>Forcespeed mode</em> option forces the drive to use the selected
	   write speed no matter of the quality of the medium. Normally modern drives
	   know the highest possible speed for different media and may reduce the
	   speed in order to grant the best write quality. This option should be used
	   with caution, the recorder usually knows better which medium to write at
	   full speed.</p>
	<p>The <em>Plextor VariRec write mode</em> allows the user to slightly adjust
	   the power of the laser. If configured properly this may reduce the jitter,
	   resulting in better sound quality and increased playability and
	   compatibility with existing CD-players. VariRec only works when the write
	   speed is set to four.</p>
